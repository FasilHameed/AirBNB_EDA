        "### The analysis of the Airbnb dataset has revealed valuable insights into various aspects of the listings in New York City. The majority of listings are in the \"Entire home/apt\" and \"Private room\" categories, indicating a preference for privacy and independence. Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most popular neighbourhoods, with higher prices and longer minimum stay requirements compared to other areas. The analysis has also highlighted the importance of pricing and availability, with variations based on room types and neighbourhoods. Geographical analysis has identified specific regions with higher prices and longer minimum stay requirements, providing guidance for selecting suitable accommodations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Based on these insights, several solutions have been proposed to address business problems. These include refining pricing strategies, promoting underrepresented neighbourhoods, enhancing search filters and user interfaces, and improving guest experiences. The findings also emphasize the significance of data-driven decision making and collaborations with local authorities to optimize operations and comply with regulations. By leveraging these insights, Airbnb can enhance the user experience, attract more hosts and guests, and improve overall business performance in the competitive short-term rental market in New York City."

        "\n",
        "- Imputing Missing Values: The \"name\" column had missing values. To handle this, an imputation method was applied to fill in the missing values with appropriate values. This ensured that the dataset remained complete and usable for further analysis.\n",

        "- Handling Missing Values: Apart from the \"name\" column, there were other columns with missing values as well. These missing values were dropped from the dataset to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the remaining data. By removing these rows with missing values, the dataset became more reliable for subsequent analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Date Type Conversion: The \"last_review\" column, which likely contained date information, was converted from its original data type to a date-time format. This conversion enabled more effective time-based analysis and visualization of the data.\n",

        "#### Overall, these data wrangling steps improved the quality and usability of the dataset for subsequent visualizations and analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Additionally, it is worth noting that outliers were not removed from the dataset intentionally. Since there were no plans to perform any modeling or statistical analysis that could be sensitive to outliers, the decision was made to retain the outliers in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Retaining the outliers allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the data distribution and potential extreme values. It is important to consider the context and purpose of the analysis when deciding whether or not to remove outliers. In this case, as outliers were not considered a hindrance to the intended visualizations, they were retained in the dataset."

'price' has a negative correlation with 'number_of_reviews' (-0.073), 'reviews_per_month' (-0.063), 'calculated_host_listings_count' (-0.013), and 'availability_365' (-0.003). These correlations suggest that, on average, higher prices tend to be associated with slightly lower numbers of reviews, lower review rates per month, fewer calculated host listings, and slightly lower availability throughout the year.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Strong Positive Correlation: There is a strong positive correlation between 'number_of_reviews' and 'reviews_per_month' (0.906). This indicates that properties with a higher number of reviews also tend to have a higher rate of reviews per month. This correlation suggests that properties with more reviews attract more frequent reviewing activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Weak Positive Correlations: There are weak positive correlations between 'number_of_reviews' and 'availability_365' (0.253), 'reviews_per_month' and 'availability_365' (0.208), and 'calculated_host_listings_count' and 'availability_365' (0.220). These correlations suggest that, on average, properties with a higher number of reviews, higher review rates per month, and more calculated host listings tend to have slightly higher availability throughout the year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the correlation heatmap reveals a mix of weak positive and negative correlations among the variables. It suggests that the number of reviews and review rates per month have the strongest relationship among the variables, while the other variables have weaker or negligible correlations with each other."

        "- Price and Latitude: There is a very weak positive correlation (0.015) between 'price' and 'latitude'. This indicates that, on average, as latitude increases, there may be a slight tendency for prices to increase slightly. However, the correlation is extremely weak, suggesting that latitude has little influence on the pricing of properties.\n",

This suggests that, on average, as longitude increases (moving eastward), there may be a slight tendency for prices to decrease. However, similar to the correlation with latitude, the correlation is relatively weak, and other factors likely have a stronger influence on pricing.\n",

This can enable data-driven decision making for various aspects of the business, including marketing, operations, and customer experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Collaboration with Local Authorities: Airbnb can collaborate with local authorities to ensure compliance with regulations and monitor the impact of short-term rentals on the housing market. This can help maintain a balance between the Airbnb ecosystem and the local communities.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Customer Reviews and Ratings: Airbnb can encourage guests to leave reviews and ratings after their stays by implementing incentives or rewards programs. This can help improve the overall trust and credibility of the platform and assist future guests in making informed decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Neighborhood Insights: Airbnb can provide more detailed information about the neighborhoods where listings are located, including nearby attractions, transportation options, and safety ratings. This would help guests choose accommodations based on their preferences and enhance their overall experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Host Education and Support: Airbnb can offer educational resources and support for hosts to optimize their listings, pricing, and hospitality skills. This would enable hosts to provide better experiences for guests and improve overall customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data Privacy and Security: Airbnb should prioritize data privacy and security measures to protect the personal information of hosts and guests. This includes implementing robust data protection protocols and compliance with applicable data privacy regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Market Expansion: Based on the analysis, Airbnb can identify areas with lower representation and potential demand for short-term rentals. This can inform their market expansion strategies, allowing them to target these areas and increase their user base.\n",
